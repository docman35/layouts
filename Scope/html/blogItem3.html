            <h3>PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSION OF AN IMPORTANT TOPIC</h3>
            <p>Are you a journalist or a creative personality? Do you want to share information with the world? Then our new project will be perfect for you to express your ideas and concepts.</p>
            <p>This project will change the way of public discussions we used to have 5 or 10 years ago in various clubs and non-profit organizations devoted to solving problems and answering the questions experts could not deal with.</p>
            <p>We are talking about a new social idea - a project that will unite people of various ages, interests, and professions into a discussion club that will be created on a basis of our website. If you have an idea to share with the world and society, or would like to offer a solution to a problem that seems to be unsolvable but is very important for your country, city or town, you will be a valuable member of our discussion club.</p>
            <p>Members of our club will have a unique opportunity to take part in discussions concerning world problems featuring America's leading political and economic consultants, celebrities, and just people who want to express their opinions about various concerns.</p>
            <p>"We will create four groups, each consisting of 15 volunteers aged from 18 to 60. Representatives of these groups will cooperate with scientists and psychologists to search for solutions to local and national economic and social issues", says Jim Smith the coordinator of the project.</p>
